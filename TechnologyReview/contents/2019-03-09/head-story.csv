Is there an alternative that won’t make us do without?,Niall Firth,"February 27, 2019","In 2013 commaSign  the world’s first burger from a lab was cooked in butter and eaten at a glitzy press conference. The burger cost £215 commaSign 000 ($330 commaSign 000 at the time) to make commaSign  and despite all the media razzmatazz commaSign  the tasters were polite but not overly impressed. “Close to meat commaSign  but not that juicy commaSign ” said one food critic.
Still commaSign  that one burger commaSign  paid for by Google cofounder Sergey Brin commaSign  was the earliest use of a technique called cellular agriculture to make edible meat products from scratch—no dead animals required. Cellular agriculture commaSign  whose products are known as cultured or lab-grown meat commaSign  builds up muscle tissue from a handful of cells taken from an animal. These cells are then nurtured on a scaffold in a bioreactor and fed with a special nutrient broth.
A little over five years later commaSign  startups around the world are racing to produce lab-grown meat that tastes as good as the traditional kind and costs about as much.
They’re already playing catch-up: “plant-based” meat commaSign  made of a mix of non-animal products that mimic the taste and texture of real meat commaSign  is already on the market. The biggest name in this area: Impossible Foods commaSign  whose faux meat sells in more than 5 commaSign 000 restaurants and fast food chains in the US and Asia and should be in supermarkets later this year. Impossible’s research team of more than 100 scientists and engineers uses techniques such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify the volatile molecules released when meat is cooked.
The key to their particular formula is the oxygen-carrying molecule heme commaSign  which contains iron that gives meat its color and metallic tang. Instead of using meat commaSign  Impossible uses genetically modified yeast to make a version of heme that is found in the roots of certain plants.
Impossible has a few competitors commaSign  particularly Beyond Meat commaSign  which uses pea protein (among other ingredients) to replicate ground beef. Its product is sold in supermarket chains like Tesco in the UK and Whole Foods in the US commaSign  alongside real meat and chicken. Both Impossible and Beyond released new commaSign  improved versions of their burgers in mid-January.
In contrast commaSign  none of the lab-grown-meat startups has yet announced a launch date for its first commercial product. But when that happens—some claim as early as the end of this year—the lab-grown approach could turn the traditional meat industry on its head.
“I suspect that cultured meat proteins can do things that plant-based proteins can’t in terms of flavor commaSign  nutrition commaSign  and performance commaSign ” says Isha Datar commaSign  who leads New Harvest commaSign  an organization that helps fund research in cellular agriculture. Datar commaSign  a cell biologist and a fellow at the MIT Media Lab commaSign  believes cultured meats will more closely resemble real meat commaSign  nutritionally and functionally commaSign  than the plant-based kinds do. The idea is that a die-hard carnivore (like me) might not feel so put off at the thought of giving up the real thing.
You might ask commaSign  why would anyone want to? The answer is that our meat consumption habits are commaSign  in a very literal sense commaSign  not sustainable.
Livestock raised for food already contribute about 15% of the world’s global greenhouse-gas emissions. (You may have heard that if cows were a country commaSign  it would be the world’s third biggest emitter.) A quarter of the planet’s ice-free land is used to graze them commaSign  and a third of all cropland is used to grow food for them. A growing population will make things worse. It’s estimated that with the population expected to rise to 10 billion commaSign  humans will eat 70% more meat by 2050. Greenhouse gases from food production will rise by as much as 92%.
In January a commission of 37 scientists reported in The Lancet that meat’s damaging effects not only on the environment but also on our health make it “a global risk to people and the planet.” In October 2018 a study in Nature found that we will need to change our diets significantly if we’re not to irreparably wreck our planet’s natural resources.
“Without changes toward more plant-based diets commaSign ” says Marco Springmann commaSign  a researcher in environmental sustainability at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the Nature paper commaSign  “there is little chance to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.”
The good news is that a growing number of people now seem to be rethinking what they eat. A recent report from Nielsen found that sales of plant-based foods intended to replace animal products were up 20% in 2018 compared with a year earlier. Veganism commaSign  which eschews not just meat but products that come from greenhouse-gas-emitting dairy livestock too commaSign  is now considered relatively mainstream.
That doesn’t necessarily equate to more vegans. A recent Gallup poll found that the number of people in the US who say they are vegan has barely changed since 2012 and stands at around just 3%. Regardless commaSign  Americans are eating less meat commaSign  even if they’re not cutting it out altogether.
Investors are betting big that this momentum will continue. Startups such as MosaMeat (cofounded by Mark Post commaSign  the scientist behind the £215 commaSign 000 burger) commaSign  Memphis Meats commaSign  Supermeat commaSign  Just commaSign  and Finless Foods have all swept up healthy sums of venture capital. The race now is to be first to market with a palatable product at an acceptable cost.
Memphis Meats’ VP of product and regulation commaSign  Eric Schulze commaSign  sees his product as complementing the real-meat industry. “In our rich cultural tapestry as a species commaSign  we are providing a new innovation to weave into our growing list of sustainable food traditions commaSign ” he says. “We see ourselves as an ‘and commaSign ’ not ‘or commaSign ’ solution to helping feed a growing world.”
The traditional meat industry doesn’t see it that way. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association in the US dismissively dubs these new approaches “fake meat.” In August 2018 commaSign  Missouri enacted a law that bans labeling any such alternative products as meat. Only food that has been “derived from harvested production of livestock or poultry” can have the word “meat” on the label in any form. Breaking that law could lead to a fine or even a year’s jail time.
The alternative-meat industry is fighting back. The Good Food Institute commaSign  which campaigns for regulations that favor plant-based and lab-grown meats commaSign  has joined forces with Tofurky (the makers of a tofu-based meat replacement since the 1980s) commaSign  the American Civil Liberties Union commaSign  and the Animal Legal Defense Fund to get the law overturned. Jessica Almy commaSign  the institute’s policy director commaSign  says the law as it stands is “nonsensical” and an “affront” to the principle of free speech. “The thinking behind the law is to make plant-based meat less appealing and to disadvantage cultured meat when it comes on the market commaSign ” she says.
Almy says she’s confident their case will be successful and is expecting a temporary injunction to be granted soon. But the Missouri battle is just the start of a struggle that could last years. In February 2018 commaSign  the US Cattlemen’s Association launched a petition that calls on the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to enact a similar federal law.
Traditional meat-industry groups have also been very vocal on how cultured meat and plant-based meats are to be regulated. Last summer a group of the biggest agricultural organizations in the US (nicknamed “The Barnyard”) wrote to President Trump asking for reassurance that the USDA will oversee cultured meat to ensure “a level playing field.” (The USDA has tougher commaSign  more stringent safety inspections than the Food and Drug Administration.)
In November 2018 commaSign  the USDA and the FDA finally released a joint statement to announce that the two regulators would share the responsibilities for overseeing lab-grown meats.
Some cultured-meat startups say this confusion over regulations is the only thing holding them back. One firm commaSign  Just commaSign  says it plans to launch a ground “chicken” product this year and has trumpeted a partnership with a Japanese livestock firm to produce a “Wagyu beef” product made from cells in the lab. Its CEO is Josh Tetrick commaSign  who’d previously founded the controversial startup Hampton Creek commaSign  Just’s forebear. (The FDA had at one time banned the firm from calling its signature product mayonnaise commaSign  as it did not contain any eggs.) Speak to Tetrick commaSign  a bullish commaSign  confident young man commaSign  and you get a sense of the drive and excitement behind the alternative-meat market. “The only [limit] to launching commaSign ” he says commaSign  “is regulatory.”
That’s optimistic commaSign  to say the least. The lab-meat movement still faces big technical hurdles. One is that making the product requires something called fetal bovine serum. FBS is harvested from fetuses taken from pregnant cows during slaughter. That’s an obvious problem for a purportedly cruelty-free product. FBS also happens to be eye-wateringly expensive. It is used in the biopharmaceutical industry and in basic cellular research commaSign  but only in tiny amounts. Cultured meat commaSign  however commaSign  requires vast quantities. All the lab-meat startups will have to use less of it—or eliminate it completely—to make their products cheap enough. Last year Finless Foods (which aims to make a fish-free version of bluefin tuna) reported that it had halved the amount of FBS it needs to grow its cells. And Schulze says the Memphis Meats team is working on ways of cutting it out entirely.
But there are other issues commaSign  says Datar commaSign  of New Harvest. She says we still don’t understand the fundamental processes well enough. While we have quite a deep understanding of animals used in medical research commaSign  such as lab mice commaSign  our knowledge of agricultural animals at a cellular level is rather thin. “I’m seeing a lot of excitement and VCs investing but not seeing a lot in scientific commaSign  material advancements commaSign ” she says. It’s going to be tricky to scale up the technology if we’re still learning how these complex biological systems react and grow.
Lab-grown meat has another—more tangible—problem. Growing muscle cells from scratch creates pure meat tissue commaSign  but the result lacks a vital component of any burger or steak: fat. Fat is what gives meat its flavor and moisture commaSign  and its texture is hard to replicate. Plant-based meats are already getting around the problem—to some extent—by using shear cell technology that forces the plant protein mixture into layers to produce a fibrous meat-like texture. But if you want to create a meat-free “steak” from scratch commaSign  some more work needs to be done. Cultured meat will need a way to grow fat cells and somehow mesh them with the muscle cells for the end result to be palatable. That has proved tricky so far commaSign  which is the main reason that first burger was so mouth-puckeringly dry.
The scientists at the Netherlands-based ­cultured-meat startup Meatable might have found a way. The team has piggybacked on medical stem-cell research to find a way of isolating pluripotent stem cells in cows by taking them from the blood in umbilical cords of newborn calves. Pluripotent cells commaSign  formed early in an embryo’s development commaSign  have the ability to develop into any type of cell in the body. This means they can also be coaxed into forming fat commaSign  muscle commaSign  or even liver cells in lab-grown meat.
Meatable’s work might mean that the cells can be tweaked to produce a steak-like product whose fat and muscle content depends on what the customer prefers: a rib-eye steak’s characteristic marbling commaSign  for example. “We can add more fat commaSign  or make it leaner—we can do anything we want to. We have new control over how we feed the cells commaSign ” says Meatable CTO Daan Luining commaSign  who is also a research director at the nonprofit Cellular Agriculture Society. “Pluripotent cells are like the hardware. The software you’re running turns it into the cell you want. It’s already in the cell—you just need to trigger it.”
But the researchers’ work is also interesting because they have found a way to get around the FBS problem: the pluripotent cells don’t require the serum to grow. Luining is clearly proud of this. “To circumvent that using a different cell type was a very elegant solution commaSign ” he says.
He concedes that Meatable is still years away from launching a commercial product commaSign  but he’s confident about its eventual prospects. “I think there will be lines outside the store that are longer than for the next iPhone commaSign ” he says.
As it stands commaSign  lab-grown meat is not quite as virtuous as you might think. While its greenhouse emissions are below those associated with the biggest villain commaSign  beef commaSign  it is more polluting than chicken or the plant-based alternatives commaSign  because of the energy currently required to produce it. A World Economic Forum white paper on the impact of alternative meats found that lab-grown meat as it is made now would produce only about 7% less in greenhouse-gas emissions than beef. Other replacements commaSign  such as tofu or plants commaSign  produced reductions of up to 25%. “We will have to see if companies will really be able to offer low-emissions products at reasonable costs commaSign ” says Oxford’s Marco Springmann commaSign  one of the paper’s coauthors.
It is also unclear how much better for you lab-grown meat would be than the real thing. One reason meat has been linked to a heightened cancer risk is that it contains heme commaSign  which could also be present in cultured meats.
And will people even want to eat it? Datar thinks so. The little research there has been on the subject backs that up. A 2017 study published in the journal PLoS One found that most consumers in the US would be willing to try lab-grown meat commaSign  and around a third were probably or definitely willing to eat it regularly.
Expecting the whole world to go vegan is unrealistic. But a report in Nature in October 2018 suggested that if everyone moved to the flexitarian lifestyle (eating mostly vegetarian but with a little poultry and fish and no more than one portion of red meat a week) commaSign  we could halve the greenhouse-gas emissions from food production and also reduce other harmful effects of the meat industry commaSign  such as the overuse of fertilizers and the waste of fresh water and land. (It could also reduce premature mortality by about 20% commaSign  according to a study in The Lancet in October commaSign  thanks to fewer deaths from ailments such as coronary heart disease commaSign  stroke commaSign  and cancer.)
Some of the biggest players in the traditional meat industry recognize this and are subtly rebranding themselves as “protein producers” rather than meat companies. Like Big Tobacco firms buying vape startups commaSign  the meat giants are also buying stakes in this new industry. In 2016 commaSign  Tyson Foods commaSign  the world’s second biggest meat processor commaSign  launched a venture capital fund to support alternative-meat producers; it’s also an investor in Beyond Meat. In 2017 commaSign  the third biggest commaSign  Cargill commaSign  invested in cultured-meat startup Memphis Meats commaSign  and Tyson followed suit in 2018. Many other big food producers are doing the same; in December 2018 commaSign  for example commaSign  Unilever bought a Dutch firm called the Vegetarian Butcher that makes a variety of non-meat products commaSign  including plant-based meat substitutes.
“A meat company doesn’t do what they do because they want to degrade the environment and don’t like animals commaSign ” says Tetrick commaSign  the Just CEO. “They do it because they think it’s the most efficient way. But if you give them a different way to grow the company that’s more efficient commaSign  they’ll do it.”
At least some in the meat industry agree. In a profile last year for Bloomberg commaSign  Tom Hayes commaSign  then the CEO of Tyson commaSign  made it clear where he saw the company’s eventual future. “If we can grow the meat without the animal commaSign ” he said commaSign  “why wouldn’t we?”"
